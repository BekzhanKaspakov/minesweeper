# My version of Minesweeper game

I was recently captivated by a version of minesweeper mini game in Dota 2.

Without much luck in finding alternatives that would satisfy me in the same way it did, I've decided to build it myself.

## Features

- Regular features of a usual minesweeper
- Added functionality for auto flagging by right-clicking revealed cell

## Planned Features

- Difficulties without having to manually apply height, width and number of mines
- Magic:
  - Add reveal ability that would cost mana
  - Mana restoring potions on revealing certain bonus cells with a stepped timer
- Play with timer
  - Probably going to be a fixed timer
  - Replenish by revealing certain bonus cells with a stepped timer
  - Scoring system
  - Leaderboard

## Need to deploy

I haven't deployed it yet. Once I do, will probably share a link here.
